# Puppy Monitoring Surveillance Camera

A software solution for monitoring your furry friends using computer vision and image processing.

## Requirements
- A webcam or IP camera
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)

## Features
- Real-time object detection to track your puppy
- Motion detection to alert you when there's activity in the frame
- Option to save snapshots or videos of your puppy's activity

## Usage
1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/[username]/puppy-surveillance.git```

2. Install the required packages

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the main script

```python main.py```


## Configuration
You can modify the `config.py` file to change the following settings:
- Camera index or IP address
- Detection threshold for motion detection
- Output file path for saving snapshots or videos

## Limitations
- May not work with all types of cameras
- May have difficulty detecting small or fast-moving objects
- Can have false positive detections in highly cluttered environments

## Future work
- Improve object detection accuracy
- Add the ability to distinguish between different types of objects in the frame
- Integrate with a cloud service for remote access and storage of data
